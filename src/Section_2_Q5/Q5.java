	 * As per the provided question, I will use the Linked list to store the information. As if i use the arraylist, 
	 * then there will be difficulty in the adding and removiing the data however, using a kind of hte data structure, it is easy to store
	 *  upto 10,000 emplyees information as in linked list due to nodes, we can easily add and remove the employee information.
	 *  
	 *  On the other hand, array list takes less time to fetch the value i.e. by using get() mehtod, we can easily fetch the value of the required
	 *  employees's data but in linked list, we have ease in manipulatiopn of addition and removing the data because of the nodes.
	 *  
	 *  Advantages of the linkedlist: -
	 *  
	 *  1. Effective performance as compared to the arraylist, as insertion and removal is easy as compared to the array list
	 *  2. Fetch the result is less effective but good as compared to the case of array list i.e. O(1) vs O(n)
	 *  3. Other thing is that, there are lots of methods available in linked list whihc helps us to add and remove in various kinds.
	 *  4. Wiht the help of list iterator, we can easily add and remove the element as the time of iteration.
	 *  5. Linked list also has ability to iterate forward or backward direction as it has listIterator.
	 *  
	 *  Hence, i canclude that, linked list is far better that the array list because of the above mentioned advatages
	 *  Therfore, i will use the concept of linked list to store upto 10,000 employees data.
